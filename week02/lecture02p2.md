## Notes on extensions processing

If you request an extension turn in the assignment *after* you receive the confirmation email.

If you request an extension, but turn in the assignment before the original due date, you don't need to worry about this!

notes:
the reason for this is a "feature" of PL in that you need to have the updated due date *before* you submit the assignment, and we need time to process and add these new due dates

if you do submit in this "nebulous window" just resubmit after you get the email, and as always feel free to reach out if questions come up!
