## Today's Main Topics

 * A bit about Viz Engines


notes:
some lecture, lab/homwork time!

# TOPIC 1: Vizualization Engines

notes: 
since we are starting to explore our first new viz engine, it is worth spending some time thinking about some questions we might want to ask our selves about said engines


---

## Evaluating Visualization Engines

 * Costs
 * Functionality
 * Aesthetics
 
notes: is this engine free or do you have to pay for it?  Does it do what I want?
Does its plots look like plots I want to make?

---

## Choices

 * Can I get ahold of this software?
 * Do I install it, or do I use it on a server?
 * What's the user interface like?
 * Is it declarative or is it procedural/imperative?
 
notes: in the HW you will look at several different forms of interfaces for making the same plot and thought a bit about how a user of the viz might go about making different plots and how some pathways to viz might be more or less intative for you and your given task 

---

## License: Software

 * What can you do with the software?
 * Can you study the software?
 * Who can you share it with?
 * Who can you give your derivative works to?
 
notes: while the viz engines we use in this class are generally open source, you may run into engines that are not or "somewhere in between"

In this case, you might have to think carefully about how you share your viz with others, you can use what you create? Can you actually study how the software works?

---

## License: Software

 * Copyleft: share and share-alike
 * Non-copyleft: share, but don't necessarily need to share-alike
 * https://choosealicense.com/
 
notes: this website has a bunch of "auto" generated licences, depending on what kind of license
you want *your* software to use

If you are ever in a position to create software, you can check this out to see what sorts of options you have.

Also, many of the open source packages we'll be using (including python) use a specific kind of license.  A lot of folks use the MIT licenses, fyi.

---

## License: Data

 * What can you do with the data?
 * How do you credit that data?
 * Can the data be redistributed, remixed, modified?
 * http://opendefinition.org/guide/data/
 * https://theodi.org/article/publishers-guide-to-open-data-licensing/

notes: additionally, the data that you chose to use might have a specific license.  So maybe you can use the data for your viz, but not share the data itself with others.

How can the data be modified?  Can you share the modified data?


---

## Accessibility

 * Is the software installed locally on your machine?
 * Is it hosted at a local or remote instance?
 * Who owns the visualizations, and how is access to them controlled?

---

## Interface

How do you interact with the software?

 * Declarative: how do you want the plot to look?
 * Imperative/Procedural: what are the steps to make the plot look that way?

---

## Evaluation: Costs

The "cost" of software is not exclusively the number of dollars you place on
the counter when you get a big cardboard box with marketing blurbs on the side.

Think about cost in several ways:

 * Monetary cost for *you* to use the software
 * Monetary cost for *someone else* to view your creations
 * Temporal cost of setting up
 * Cognitive cost for learning and using the system (documentation matters!)
 * Transmission cost for sharing your creations

---

## Evaluation: Aesthetics

Visualization is trendy.

When you construct something, think about the different ways it will be
interpreted:

 * How will the viewer understand the story of the data?
 * What will the _message_ of the visualization be?
 * Does the visualization say something about you and your handling of the data
   or utilization of tools?
